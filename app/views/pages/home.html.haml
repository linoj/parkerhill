    %p
      Hello, my name is Jon Linowes.
      I build web applications.

      I solve real world problems with practical yet elegant user-centric solutions based on business priorities.

    %h4 WHAT I DO
    %p
      A web application is a dynamic website backed by a database, personalized for your visitors, and valuable for the services it delivers.
    %p
      My strong background in technical implementation, project leadership, and entrepreneurial management means I can wear many hats, as situations demand. 
    %p
      I can design, build, and deliver your entire project: soup to nuts. Or you can contract me to work on specific parts as you require, like information architecture, user interface, and software development.
