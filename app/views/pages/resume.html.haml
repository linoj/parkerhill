      I solve real world problems with practical yet elegant user-centric solutions based on business priorities. I subscribe to agile, behavior driven (BDD), TATFT, DRY, progressive enhancement, “Don't make me think”, and open source approaches to software development. I love to love my work.

        %em A personal note
      %p.indent
        About 6 years ago we moved to "north country" from southern New Hampshire, with 4 children in tow, to an old dairy farm where the farmer was retiring. We'd been coming up north for years, camping, hiking, and skiing, and one Columbus Day weekend while checking out the real estate market, somewhat spontaneously, we put a deposit on this property. The old farmhouse required extensive renovation; a few years later we moved in.

        I work primarily from my home-office on web application projects for various clients. I also build and run my own web apps and open-source projects. While I live too far for a daily commute to most locations in New England, I am available to be on-site several days a week, as needed.
